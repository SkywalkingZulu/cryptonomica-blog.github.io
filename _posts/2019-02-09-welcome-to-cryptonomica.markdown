[Cryptonomica.net](https://cryptonomica.net) is an online and offline identity verification service and a global database of verified identities with keys for signing electronic documents, blockchain transactions and KYC.

We also provide online dispute resolution for contracts signed with verified keys via London based arbitration with awards (decisions) legally enforceable under international law in almost all countries.

Our mission is to use modern technologies such as cryptography, blockchain, decentralized applications, and international law with some law hacks, to build global borderless space for contracts and electronic documents interchange, where applicable law can be chosen and even created by users, but contracts are still recognizable and enforceable in legacy national legal systems.
